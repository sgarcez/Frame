FRAME
===========


This is an old Django Build to allow for design mockups for mobile devices to be composited onto product shots of the devices.

Production was halted with the advent of similar tools like [placeit](http://placeit.breezi.com/).


Instructions:

- create a yourname_settings under `project/project/localsettings/`
- alias yourname.settings to localsettings in that same dir
- create a virtualenv just inside your checkout dir and name it `'env'`
- activate your env with `source env/bin.activate` and install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt`
